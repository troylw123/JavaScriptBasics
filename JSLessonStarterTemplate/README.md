## JavaScript In Class Demo

Letâ€™s see how we can use JS to DOM manipulate via using material from our JavaScript Basics notes and utilizing fetch for the first time to APIs.

Template code will be located here in this repo for us to clone to our local machines at the beginning of the demo.

Final code will be in it's own repo, [JSLessonFinalVersion](https://github.com/KateLockhart/JSLessonFinalVersion), for you to view/use during the demo to proofread for syntax or spelling errors.


### APIs
We will be using:
- [Random.dog API](https://github.com/AdenFlorian/random.dog) by [David Valachovic](https://github.com/adenflorian)
and/or
- [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/) by [Aden Forshaw](https://github.com/AdenForshaw), docs [here](https://docs.thecatapi.com/)
